## What's new

As we work on the next [major release], this release focus on stabilization and bug fixes, but there is also some new features.

#### `string::notMatches` assertion
The new `notMatches` assertion on `string` asserter allow to test that a string do not match a regexp.

#### `@os` annotation
If you want to write OS specific tests, atoum now provide an `@os` assertion to check OS before launching test

Here is an example : 
```php
namespace tests\units
{
    /**
     * @os !darwin
     */
    class stdClass extends \mageekguy\atoum\test
    {
        /**
         * @os linux
         */
        public function testOnlyOnLinux()
        {

        }

        /**
         * @os !linux
         */
        public function testEverywhereButLinuxAndDarwin()
        {

        }
    }
}
```

#### Dot report
If you need a condensed output of atoum execution, we had a new Dot report who only display test execution progression, without any other details :

```$ bin/atoum -udr -f tests/units/classes/test.php
............................................................ [60/65]
.....                                                        [65/65]

Success (1 test, 65/65 methods, 0 void method, 0 skipped method, 872 assertions)!
```

#### Memory usage
Memory usage information displayed after test suite execution now display real maximum memory usage.

Previously, in case of garbage collector execution, memory usage value could be wrong.
