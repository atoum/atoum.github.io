# Back from atoum's day 2016

This year we got the first [2016-04-27-atoum-s-day](atoum's day)! This event is both a meeting between contributors and a meeting between users.

Unfortunatelly, due to some strike in France during this event, every registred people couldn't reach us and some need to leave earlier. Hopefully, it still was a good meeting, with intresting talks. We hope, as team, that our few users that were there enjoy the moment too.

But this event, was full of surprise and quite exciting! We are really happy to speak about it, and we will probably create a new event of this kind in the future.

## Team meeting

We create this event also to speak between each contributors. This allow us to reach some points, and think to a new roadmap. We also check what we could do to improve atoum and his community. Some of the point will be detailled lower and some will be explain during the year. We would like to keep some new stuff under the hood, to allow you discovering it.

One of the point we speak about was the [](phptour) of this year. During this event we got an area in the stand of Norsys. It help us to talk to people, make some demo, and give our first goodies to you, our community. And we enjoy it ;)

TODO : put some pictures / tweet
legend : our first goodies, some stickers


## Talks and user meeting

We got four talks, instead of six due to time and strike. But it was very intresting talks and each of them were registred (badly, but we got it). You can discover it on youtube, if you understand french (or the google subtitle), in the ()[dedicated playlist].


## Roadmap & next steps

We try to think to what are missing now or what was blaoted in atoum and try to create the next steps. For the code, we still need to think about the points we identified, before spreading them. By the way, if you want to know more about it, just join us in our ()[chat room] and ask us.

About the rest, we almost put in evidence that our main weakness is the communication. So we will try to spread more words about atoum on social media but also in other place like meetup or conferences.

Some improvement that we see are sometimes just quick-win or nearly quick-win like

* blog comments, that are now available
* a "()[standard edition]" of atoum with some extension build-in.


Some other are more complicated, but can also have a a quick start :

* core contributors documentation (where to find entry point, how to extend it, ...)
* extension contributors documentation (how to create it, important thing to check, ...)
* how we release new version, how long we maintain it, ...
* create a more clear communication related to our roadmap

Some points are more complicated but also more crucial and because we love you, here is one of this point. We know that security are important for you, we will start to use gpg key to sign our commit and mak it more trustable. We already know that we need to create a build machine for our phar, but once it will be created, we will sign our phar too. This will allow you to check the validity of the new phar and improve your security.

And we still got some other things under the hood... Like we say at the start of this post, this event was intresting and concluant!


## Conclusion

Sometimes, when you create a new project you get some secreat dream about it. Sometimes, you just want to create great tools for great people. And sometimes this comes to reality. When the [https://www.github.com/mageekguy](Frédéric Hardy) create ogo, and first answer to his needs. But after a while and renaming it to atoum, a dreams comes in. A dream about a meeting beetween contributors and users, a dream about a day with some kind of magic.

A few years later, after the the leaving of Frédéric, the new team create this day, without knowing it was a dream. This is the magic of dream.


Now we get back to testing & coding,
Injecting some of this magic to what we do,
Enjoy
