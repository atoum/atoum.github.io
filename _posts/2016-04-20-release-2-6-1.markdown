## What's new

Since the 2.5.0 release some changes have been made. Here are some change highlights.

### Looper interface

The loop system of atoum has been improved. The logic has been extracted and a looper interface has been created.

So it allows to create new extensions. And, this is what append: [Adrien Gallou][@agallou] has created the new [autoloop-extension](https://github.com/atoum/autoloop-extension) extension that launches your test on file change!


### In-memory cache for resolved asserters improvements

[Julien Bianchi][@jubianchi] has done a great job on the cache resolver and has made *many* improvements. Check the [pull request](https://github.com/atoum/atoum/pull/569) to have more information about it.


### Documentation

We have made *some* change on the documentation... Now, it should be clearer and easier to use.

* The design of the website has been adapted to the documentation,
* The structure is easier to understand,
* It's now English first instead of French first, so it's easier to translate.

You should try it, go to the [documentation](http://docs.atoum.org)!
