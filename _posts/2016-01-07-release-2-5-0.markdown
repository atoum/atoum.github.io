### Asserting on child arrays

Asserting on arrays has just become a bit more awesome. Remember when you wanted to assert on child arrays, you had to do things like:

{% highlight php %}
<?php 

$array = [
    'foo',
    42,
    'baz' => [
        'boo'
    ]
];

$this
    ->array($array)
        ->string[0]-isEqualTo('foo')
        ->integer[1]-isEqualTo(42)
        ->hasKey('baz')
    ->array($array['baz'])
        ->string[0]->isEqualTo('boo')
;
{% endhighlight %}

The chain was broken because you were not able to easily assert on child arrays. With this new release, atoum brings a
new helper method to do this:

{% highlight php %}
<?php

$this
    ->array($array)
        ->string[0]-isEqualTo('foo')
        ->integer[1]-isEqualTo(42)
        ->child['baz'](function($child) {
                $child->string[0]->isEqualTo('boo');
            }
        )
    ->array($array['baz'])
        ->string[0]->isEqualTo('boo')
;
{% endhighlight %}

You might also know that atoum provides an alternative syntax to assert on child arrays:

{% highlight php %}
<?php

$this
    ->array($array)
        ->string[0]-isEqualTo('foo')
        ->integer[1]-isEqualTo(42)
        ->string['baz'][0]->isEqualTo('boo')
;
{% endhighlight %}

Just choose the one you prefer and fits the best to your needs.

### `castToArray` and `iterator` asserters

This is now possible to assert on iterators thanks to a dedicated `iterator` asserter group:

{% highlight php %}
<?php

$iterator = new \someIterator();

$this
    ->iterator($iterator)
        ->hasSize(5)
;
{% endhighlight %}

This asserter will only check that the subject value implements the `Iterator` interface and will allow you to use a 
single `hasSize` assertion as regular iterators can't be randomly accessed.

`castToArray` to the rescue: This new asserter will let you cast any value to an array to assert on it. This is very usefull
with iterators:

{% highlight php %}
<?php

$this
    ->castToArray($iterator)
        ->hasSize(5)
        ->object[0]->isInstanceOf('stdClass')
;
{% endhighlight %}

There is also a `toArray` shortcut method to cast any `iterator` or `string` asserter group to an array:

{% highlight php %}
<?php

$this
    ->iterator($iterator)
        ->hasSize(5)
        ->toArray
            ->object[0]->isInstanceOf('stdClass')
            
    ->string('Hello World!')
        ->toArray
            ->string[0]->isEqualTo('H')
;
{% endhighlight %}

### `resource` asserter

The `resource` asserter group provides useful asserters to check resources' types. For instance:
{% highlight php %}
<?php

$this
    ->resource($var)
        ->isOfType('stream')
;
{% endhighlight %}

is true if the resource `$var` is a stream. In many cases, we can use the `is*` 
magic methods as a replacement of `isOfType`. Thus:
{% highlight php %}
<?php

$this
    ->resource($var)
        ->isStream()
;
{% endhighlight %}

is strictly equivalent.

Finally, if you would like more thinner asserters on the type of the resource, you can use `->resource($var)->type->…` 
where `type` returns a `string` asserter group.

Discover all the available resources in PHP at [http://php.net/resource][php_resources].

### Improvements on mock

Mock generator has been updated to support variadic arguments passed by reference. Method declared with such arguments
will be correctly mocked.

Another interesting feature around mocks is the automatic mock generation and injection. When you wanted to use mocks
in a test, you had to do things like:
 
{% highlight php %}
<?php

class cachingIterator extends atoum
{
    public function test__construct()
    {
        $this
            ->given($iterator = new \mock\iterator())
            ->then
                ->object(new \cachingIterator($iterator))               
        ;
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Now instead of manually generating the mock, you can ask atoum to do it for you:
 
{% highlight php %}
<?php

class cachingIterator extends atoum
{
    public function test__construct(\iterator $iterator)
    {
        $this
            ->object(new \cachingIterator($iterator))               
        ;
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

When you add type-hints to a test method (which is not associated with a data provider) atoum will automatically generate 
mocks for its arguments ad inject them automatically.

## Asides

### Stubs

atoum [stubs][stubs] has been updated according to the features introduced in this release. Don't forget to add
them to your `composer.json` if you want to have a better IDE integration (like autocompletion).

### Extensions

Some extensions has been updated:

* The [deprecated-extension][deprecated_extension] has been published,
* The [blackfire-extension][blackfire_extension] has been published,
* The [ruler-extension][ruler_extension] has been updated with 4 new features, see the [changelog][ruler_extension_changelog].

Thanks [Adrien Gallou][@agallou] for the amazing work he did on those extensions!

### Documentation

We also updated missing parts of the documentation. Again, [Adrien Gallou][@agallou] and our two [doc masters][@doc] did an amazing job!
